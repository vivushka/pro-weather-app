# pro-weather-app
My first code on GIT and it's called ProWeatherApp
 
I managed to create a project for determining the weather in hundreds of different cities, also with this application, you can determine your geolocation, change Celsius to Fahrenheit, and also get acquainted with the current weather forecast for the next few days.
